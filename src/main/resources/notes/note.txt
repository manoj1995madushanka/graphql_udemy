for double values schema define Float
    ex : marksObtained of query

define "type" for output objects

define "input" for request object

===============
why we need resolver
    without resolver all the mapping logic of returning object will execute and graphQL will
       ignore not requested data when returning response
    this will reduce app performance so that is why we need resolver
